RUT	front	intro	f68r			0		# Introduction to Ruth<br><br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of Ruth<br><br>1. How Ruth came to Bethlehem with Naomi (1:1–22)<br>1. Boaz helps Ruth as she gleans (2:1–23)<br>1. Boaz and Ruth at the threshing floor (3:1–18)<br>1. How Ruth became the wife of Boaz (4:1–16)<br>1. Obed born to Ruth and Boaz; the genealogy of David (4:13–22)<br><br>### What is the Book of Ruth about?<br><br>This book is about a non-Israelite woman named Ruth. It tells how she came to join the people of Yahweh. The book also explains how Ruth became an ancestor of King David.<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>This book traditionally has the title **Ruth** because she is the main person in it. Translators can use a title such as ***The Book about Ruth***. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### When did the events in the Book of Ruth occur?<br><br>The story of Ruth is set during the time when there were **judges** in Israel. This was after the people of Israel had entered into the land of Canaan, but before they had a king. The “judges” were men and women whom God chose to help the Israelites defeat their enemies. These leaders usually continued to help the people by deciding disputes among them. They also helped them make important decisions. Many of these leaders served all the people of Israel, but some of them may have served only certain tribes.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### Why does Scripture include a book about a woman from the foreign land of Moab?<br><br>In a period when Israel was often unfaithful to Yahweh, a woman from Moab shows great faith in him. The Israelites’ frequent lack of faith in Yahweh is contrasted with the faith of this woman from a foreign land. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faithful]])<br><br>### What important marriage custom is found in the Book of Ruth?<br><br>Israelites practiced what is called ***levirate marriage***. In this custom, the closest male relative of a man who died without any children was obligated to provide for his widow by marrying her. Usually this would be one of the man’s brothers. Any children born to them were to be regarded as children of the dead man. They did this so that the dead man would have descendants. If the closest relative did not marry the woman, another relative could fulfil this obligation.<br><br>### What was a **kinsman-redeemer**?<br><br>A person’s close relative or relatives were expected to act as ***kinsmen-redeemers*** (2:20 ULT) for him or her. They were responsible to provide for a relative in need, fulfil obligations of ***levirate marriage***, and buy back land into the family that had been sold to someone outside of the family. In the Book of Ruth, Boaz is one such kinsman-redeemer.<br><br>### What was **gleaning** in the Book of Ruth?<br><br>In Israel, poor people were allowed to follow after the men who harvested a field. These **gleaners** picked up stalks of grain that the harvesters missed or dropped. In this way, poor people were able to find some food. Ruth became a gleaner in a field belonging to Boaz.<br><br>### What is covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty?<br><br>A covenant is a formal, binding agreement between two parties that one or both parties must fulfill. Covenant faithfulness or covenant loyalty is when a person does what they said they would do, according to the covenant that they had made. God made a covenant with Israel, in which he promised that he would love and be faithful to the Israelites. The Israelites were to do the same toward him and toward each other.<br><br>The Book of Ruth shows that what kinsmen-redeemers do for their relatives is part of Israel’s duties in God’s covenant with them. The story of Boaz, Ruth, and Naomi gives examples to all of Israel of the good effects of covenant faithfulness. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/covenantfaith]])<br><br>### What function did city gates have in the ancient Near East?<br><br>City gates in the time of Boaz were meeting places for the city elders. Elders were honored men who decided business matters and legal matters together. The city walls were thick, especially at the entryways, and the gates had guard towers beside and above them. Therefore the gateway opening provided a large shady area for public meetings, and there were places for important people to sit. For this reason, Boaz and the other elders sat in the gateway.<br><br>Some English Bible versions speak of Boaz sitting ***at*** the city gate, but it may be best for translators to make clear that Boaz sat ***in*** the city gateway.<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### How does the Book of Ruth change from one topic to another topic?<br><br>The Book of Ruth often changes to new topics or new parts of the story. The ULT uses various words to indicate these changes, such as ***so,*** ***then,*** and ***now***. Translators should use the ways most natural in their own languages to signal these changes.<br>
RUT	1	intro	irf4			0		# Ruth 01 General Notes<br><br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>### **It happened in the days when the judges ruled**<br><br>The events of this book occur during the period of Judges. The book is concurrent with the book of Judges. To understand the historical context of the book, the translator may wish to review the book of Judges.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Women without a husband or children<br><br>In the ancient Near East, if a woman lacked a husband or sons, she was considered to be in a dire circumstance. She would not have been able to provide for herself. This is why Naomi told her daughters to remarry.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Contrast<br><br>The actions of Ruth the Moabite are intended to contrast with the actions of Naomi the Jew. Ruth shows great faith in Naomi’s God, while Naomi does not trust in Yahweh. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/faith]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/trust]])<br>

RUT	1	19	xnb3		הֲ⁠זֹ֥את נָעֳמִֽי	1	Is this Naomi?	Since it had been many years since Naomi lived in Bethlehem and now she no longer has her husband and two sons, it is likely that the women were expressing doubt that this woman was actually Naomi.

RUT	2	1	b4q7		אִ֚ישׁ גִּבּ֣וֹר חַ֔יִל	1	a man of great worth	***a prominent, wealthy man***. This means that Boaz was prosperous and well known in his community, with a good reputation.
RUT	2	1	ab09		מִ⁠מִּשְׁפַּ֖חַת אֱלִימֶ֑לֶךְ	1	from the clan of Elimelek	The use of the term ***clan*** here means that Boaz was related to Elimelek but did not have the same parents as Elimelek.  The text is not saying that the clan was named after Elimelek or that Elimelek was the patriarch or leader of the clan.
RUT	2	2	am6a		ר֨וּת הַ⁠מּוֹאֲבִיָּ֜ה	1	Ruth, the Moabite woman	Here the story resumes. Indicate this in the way that your language restarts telling the events of a story after giving background information.

RUT	2	3	ab11		מִ⁠מִּשְׁפַּ֥חַת אֱלִימֶֽלֶךְ	1	from the clan of Elimelek	The use of the term ***clan*** here means that Boaz was related to Elimelek but did not have the same parents as Elimelek.  The text is not saying that the clan was named after Elimelek or that Elimelek was the patriarch or leader of the clan.
RUT	2	4	vys2	figs-informremind	וְ⁠הִנֵּה	1	Then behold,	The word **behold** alerts us to the important event of Boaz arriving at the field and seeing Ruth for the first time.

See verses such as Leviticus 19:10 and Deuteronomy 24:21.

RUT	2	15	a5z9		גַּ֣ם בֵּ֧ין הָֽ⁠עֳמָרִ֛ים	1	even among the bundles	Here, the word **even** lets the workers know that they are to do above and beyond what they normally do.

RUT	2	20	ur7z		אֲשֶׁר֙ לֹא־עָזַ֣ב	1	who has not forsaken	The word ***who*** is most probably referring to Yahweh, who has continued to be faithful to the living and the dead by acting through Boaz. A less likely possibility is that it is referring to Boaz.

She could see that Boaz would be the best husband for her. She also thought that Boaz, as a kinsman-redeemer, had an obligation to marry her. This could be true because, even though Ruth was a Gentile by birth, she had become part of Naomi’s family and part of the nation of Israel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br>

Naomi uses this question to tell Ruth what she planned to do.

RUT	3	1	uw2p	figs-metaphor	לָ֛⁠ךְ מָנ֖וֹחַ	1	a resting place for you	This does not mean a place to rest temporarily from being tired. It means a place of permanent comfort and security, in a good home with a husband. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

This word marks what follows as the result of verse 1. In other words, Naomi advises Ruth what to do (3:2-4) because she desires to find a good, secure home for Ruth (3:1) If it is more clear in your language to state the reason after the result, you may want to put verse 1 after verses 2-4, marked as verses 1-4 together. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]])

This statement summarizes the actions that Ruth will do in verse 7. If people understand from this that Ruth did these actions in verse 6 and then did them again in verse 7, then you could translate this sentence as ***and she obeyed her mother-in-law***. Or if it would make the order of events more clear, you could move this sentence to the end of verse 7, then combine the verse numbers as a verse bridge (6-7).

Boaz sees this as Ruth showing unselfish kindness and family loyalty to Naomi. By marrying Naomi’s relative, Ruth would also provide for Naomi, honor Naomi’s son, and continue Naomi’s family line.
RUT	3	10	cbd3		הָ⁠רִאשׁ֑וֹן	1	at the beginning	This refers to the way that Ruth had earlier provided for her mother-in-law by staying with her and gleaning grain for food for them.
RUT	3	10	n84d	figs-idiom	לְ⁠בִלְתִּי־לֶ֗כֶת אַחֲרֵי֙	1	by not going after	***because you have not looked for marriage among***. Ruth could have ignored Naomi’s need and looked for a young and handsome husband for herself outside of Naomi’s relatives, but she did not. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]])
RUT	3	11	jdr6	grammar-connect-logic-result	וְ⁠עַתָּ֗ה	1	Connecting Statement:	This phrase indicates that what came before in verse 10 is the reason for what follows in verse 11. This can be indicated with a word like ***Therefore***. If it is clearer in your language to put the reason after the result, the order would be: Boaz is motivated to perform the role of kinsman-redeemer (verse 11) ***because*** he has seen how much kindness Ruth has shown to Naomi (verse 10). If you choose this order, you will need to combine the verses and the verse numbers (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-logic-result]]).

See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20/zu5f) and make sure that it also makes sense here.
RUT	3	13	gcl8	figs-explicit	אִם־יִגְאָלֵ֥⁠ךְ	1	if he will redeem you	***redeem*** here means “marry according to our custom concerning widows.” Boaz is referring to the expectation that the closest male relative of Ruth’s dead husband would marry her and raise a son to carry on the dead man’s family name.

RUT	4	intro	pz6m			0		# Ruth 04 General Notes<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### King David<br><br>Despite being a Moabitess, Ruth became an ancestress of David. David was Israel’s greatest king. It may be surprising that a Gentile would become a part of such an important lineage, but it reminds us that God loves all people. Ruth had great faith in Yahweh. This shows us that God welcomes all who trust in him. <br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### **You must also acquire Ruth the Moabite woman**<br><br>With the privilege of using the family’s land came the responsibility to take care of the widows of the family. Therefore, the relative who wanted to use Naomi’s land had to also help Ruth to have a son who would carry on the family name and inheritance and provide for her.<br><br>### **This was the custom in former times**<br><br>This is a comment made by the writer of the text. This indicates that there was a considerable period of time between the events that occurred and the time when they were written down.

RUT	4	1	jdr9	figs-informremind	וְ⁠הִנֵּ֨ה	1	And behold,	The word **behold** alerts us to the important event of Boaz seeing the exact person whom he wanted to see walking by. Your language may also have a specific way of alerting someone to pay careful attention to what happens next in the story. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-informremind]])
RUT	4	1	kz1g		הַ⁠גֹּאֵ֤ל	1	the kinsman-redeemer	This was the closest living male relative to Elimelek. See how you translated **kinsman-redeemer** in [2:20](../02/20/zu5f).
RUT	4	1	ab38	figs-idiom	פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	a certain someone	Boaz did not actually say these words; instead, he called the kinsman-redeemer by his name. This is an idiom that means that this is a specific person but the name is not given. The narrator has substituted this general term for the person’s name either because the specific name is not important for the story or the man’s name had been forgotten. If your language has an idiom to refer to a specific person without using his name, use that here. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-idiom]]).
RUT	4	1	ab39	figs-quotations	פְּלֹנִ֣י אַלְמֹנִ֑י	1	a certain someone	In many languages, this is an awkward and unnatural way for someone to address another person. A way to make this more natural could be to turn this into an indirect quotation as in the UST. A combination of indirect and direct quotation is also possible: “Boaz called him by name, and said, ‘Turn aside and sit down here.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]]).

If that is so in your language, see the UST for a way that is more clear. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/grammar-connect-exceptions]])
RUT	4	4	u548		וְ⁠אָנֹכִ֖י אַחֲרֶ֑י⁠ךָ	1	and I am after you	Boaz was the next nearest kinsman to Elimelek, and so had the second right to redeem the land.

RUT	4	6	sx9k		אַשְׁחִ֖ית אֶת־נַחֲלָתִ֑⁠י	1	damaging my own inheritance	The man would need to give some of his wealth in exchange for the property. Then if he were to marry Ruth, that property would belong to her son, not to his own children. In that way, he would be taking away from the wealth that his own children would inherit from him and giving it instead to the children that Ruth might bear. Alternate translation: “taking away from my own children’s inheritance.”

As Ruth marries Boaz, she will move into his house. “House” can be a metonym the represents “family,” so this also refers to becoming part of Boaz’s family by being his wife.

The first phrase introduces the naming event, and the second repeats it in order to report the event. If this is confusing, the two phrases can be combined. ***So the neighbor women gave him the name Obed*** or ***The women of the neighborhood said…and they named him Obed***
RUT	4	17	fkf2		יֻלַּד־בֵּ֖ן לְ⁠נָעֳמִ֑י	1	A son has been born to Naomi	***It is as though Naomi has a son again***. It was understood that the child was Naomi’s grandson, not her physical son, but he would carry on the family line of both Naomi and Ruth.

RUT	4	18	mzm1		תּוֹלְד֣וֹת פָּ֔רֶץ	1	the generations of Perez	***the successive descendants of our clan, starting with Perez***. Because it was mentioned earlier that Perez was the son of Judah, the writer continues listing the family line that came from Perez. Verse 17 was the end of the story about Naomi and Ruth, and verse 18 begins a final section that lists the family line of the clan of Ephrathah, showing how important Obed was as the grandfather of King David. Use a connecting word that signals that this is a new section. You may also need to make it clear that this verse refers to a much earlier time than the time period of the story.
