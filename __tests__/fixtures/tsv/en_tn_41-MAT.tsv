MAT	front	intro	sa9c			0		# Introduction to the Gospel of Matthew<br>## Part 1: General Introduction<br><br>### Outline of the Book of Matthew<br><br>1. The birth of Jesus Christ and the beginning of his ministry (1:1-4:25)<br>1. Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount (5:1-7:28)<br>1. Jesus illustrates the kingdom of God through acts of healing (8:1-9:34)<br>1. Jesus’ teaching about mission and the kingdom (9:35-10:42)<br>1. Jesus’ teaching about the gospel of the kingdom of God. The beginning of opposition to Jesus. (11:1-12:50)<br>1. Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of God (13:1-52)<br>1. Further opposition to Jesus and misunderstanding of the kingdom of God (13:53-17:57)<br>1. Jesus’ teaching about life in the kingdom of God (18:1-35)<br>1. Jesus ministers in Judea (19:1-22:46)<br>1. Jesus’ teaching about the final judgment and salvation (23:1-25:46)<br>1. The crucifixion of Jesus, his death and resurrection (26:1-28:19)<br><br>### What is the book of Matthew about?<br><br>The Gospel of Matthew is one of four books in the New Testament that describe some of the life of Jesus Christ. The authors of the gospels wrote about different aspects of who Jesus was and what he did. Matthew showed that Jesus was the Messiah, and God would save Israel through him. Matthew often explained that Jesus fulfilled the Old Testament prophecies about the Messiah. This may indicate that he expected most of his first readers to be Jewish. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])<br><br>### How should the title of this book be translated?<br><br>Translators may choose to call this book by its traditional title, “The Gospel of Matthew,” or “The Gospel according to Matthew.” Or they may choose a title that may be clearer, such as, “The Good News about Jesus that Matthew wrote.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-names]])<br><br>### Who wrote the Book of Matthew?<br><br>The book does not give the name of the author. However, since early Christian times, most Christians have thought that the author was the Apostle Matthew.<br><br>## Part 2: Important Religious and Cultural Concepts<br><br>### What is the “kingdom of heaven?”<br><br>Matthew spoke of the kingdom of heaven in the same way that other gospel writers spoke of the kingdom of God. The kingdom of heaven represents God ruling over all people and all creation everywhere. Those whom God accepts into his kingdom will be blessed. They will live with God forever.<br><br>### What were Jesus’ teaching methods?<br><br>The people regarded Jesus as a rabbi. A rabbi is a teacher of God’s law. Jesus taught in similar ways as other religious teachers in Israel. He had students who followed him wherever he went. These students were called disciples. He often told parables. Parables are stories that teach moral lessons. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/lawofmoses]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/disciple]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/parable]])<br><br>## Part 3: Important Translation Issues<br><br>### What are the Synoptic Gospels?<br><br>The Gospels of Matthew, Mark, and Luke are called the Synoptic Gospels because they have many similar passages. The word “synoptic” means to “see together.”<br><br>The texts are considered “parallel” when they are the same or almost the same among two or three gospels. When translating parallel passages, translators should use the same wording and make them as similar as possible.<br><br>### Why does Jesus refer to himself as the “Son of Man”?<br><br>In the gospels, Jesus calls himself the “Son of Man.” It is a reference to Daniel 7:13-14. In this passage there is a person described as a “son of man.” That means the person was someone who looked like a human being. God gave authority to the son of man to rule over the nations forever. And all the people will worship him forever.<br><br>Jews of Jesus’ time did not use “Son of Man” as a title for anyone. Therefore, Jesus used it for himself to help them understand who he truly was. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sonofman]])<br><br>Translating the title “Son of Man” can be difficult in many languages. Readers may misunderstand a literal translation. Translators can consider alternatives, such as “The Human One.” It may also be helpful to include a footnote to explain the title.<br><br>### What are the major issues in the text of the Book of Matthew?<br><br>The following verses are found in older versions of the Bible but are not included in most modern versions:<br><br>* “Bless those who curse you, do good to those who hate you” (5:44)<br>* “For yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen” (6:13)<br>* “But this kind of demon does not go out except with prayer and fasting” (17:21)<br>* “For the Son of Man came to save that which was lost” (18:11)<br>* “Many are called, but few are chosen” (20:16)<br>* “Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! for you devour widows’ houses, while you make a show of long prayers. You will therefore receive greater condemnation.” (23:14)<br><br>Translators are advised not to include these passages. However, if in the translators’ region, there are older versions of the Bible that include one or more of these passages, the translators can include them. If they are included, they should be put inside square brackets ([]) to indicate that they were probably not original to Matthew’s Gospel. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/translate-textvariants]])<br><br>
MAT	1	intro	y7kk			0		# Matthew 01 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set a quotation from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this for the quoted material in 1:23.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Genealogy<br><br>A genealogy is a list that records a person’s ancestors or descendants. Jews used genealogies to choose the right man to become king. They did this because only a son of a king could become king. Most important people had records of their genealogies.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Use of the passive voice<br><br>Matthew uses the passive voice very purposefully in this chapter to indicate that Mary did not have a sexual relationship with anyone. She became pregnant with Jesus because the Holy Spirit performed a miracle. Many languages do not have a passive voice, so translators in those languages must find other ways to present the same truths. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br>

If your translation divides the text into sections, be sure that the reader understands that the whole sermon is one large section.<br><br>Matthew 5:3-10, known as the Beatitudes or Blessings, has been set apart by being set farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text, with each line beginning with the word “blessed.” This way of placing the words on the page highlights the poetic form of this teaching.<br><br>Jesus spoke about many different subjects in this sermon, so you may wish to help the reader by putting an empty line into the text whenever Jesus changed the subject.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “His disciples”<br><br>It is possible to refer to anyone who followed Jesus as a follower or disciple. Jesus selected twelve of his followers to become his closest disciples, “the twelve disciples.” They would later become known as the apostles.<br>

This is a metaphor referring to spiritual health. Often Jewish people used the phrase “bad eye” to refer to greed.

MAT	8	21	hlx9		ἐπίτρεψόν μοι πρῶτον ἀπελθεῖν καὶ θάψαι τὸν πατέρα μου	1	allow me first to go and bury my father	It is unclear whether the man’s father has died and he will bury him immediately, or if the man wants to stay for a longer amount of time until his father dies so he can bury him then. The main point is that the man wants to do something else first before he follows Jesus.
MAT	8	22	h7fb	figs-metaphor	ἄφες τοὺς νεκροὺς θάψαι τοὺς ἑαυτῶν νεκρούς	1	leave the dead to bury their own dead	Jesus does not mean literally that dead people will bury other dead people. Possible meanings of “the dead”: 1) it is a metaphor for those who will soon die, or 2) it is a metaphor for those who do not follow Jesus and are spiritually dead. The main point is that a disciple must not let anything delay him from following Jesus. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])

MAT	8	23	sl7v		ἠκολούθησαν αὐτῷ οἱ μαθηταὶ αὐτοῦ	1	his disciples followed him	Try to use the same words for “disciple” and “follow” that you used in ([Matthew 8:21-22](./21.md)).
MAT	8	24	j55j		ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of showing this. Alternate translation: “Suddenly” or “Without warning”
MAT	8	24	x7k1	figs-activepassive	σεισμὸς μέγας ἐγένετο ἐν τῇ θαλάσσῃ	1	there arose a great storm on the sea	This can be stated in active form. Alternate translation: “a powerful storm arose on the sea” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])

MAT	8	25	b2wh	figs-inclusive	σῶσον…ἀπολλύμεθα	1	Save us…we are about to die	If you need to translate these words as inclusive or exclusive, then inclusive is best.

Alternate translation: “You should not be afraid…faith!” or “There is nothing for you to be afraid of…faith!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	8	26	r5ve		ὀλιγόπιστοι	1	you of little faith	“you who have such little faith.” Jesus addresses his disciples this way because their anxiety about the storm shows they have little faith in him to control it. See how you translated this in [Matthew 6:30](../06/30.md).
MAT	8	27	u2qh	figs-rquestion	ποταπός ἐστιν οὗτος, ὅτι καὶ οἱ ἄνεμοι καὶ ἡ θάλασσα αὐτῷ ὑπακούουσιν	1	What sort of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?	“Even the winds and the sea obey him! What sort of man is this?” This rhetorical question shows that the disciples were surprised. Alternate translation: “This man is unlike any man we have ever seen! Even the wind and the waves obey him!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	8	27	k5mk	figs-personification	καὶ οἱ ἄνεμοι καὶ ἡ θάλασσα αὐτῷ ὑπακούουσιν	1	even the winds and the sea obey him	For people or animals to obey or disobey is not surprising, but for wind and water to obey is very surprising. This personification describes the natural elements as being able to hear and respond like people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-personification]])

MAT	8	28	ylu6		ἐξερχόμενοι, χαλεποὶ λείαν ὥστε μὴ ἰσχύειν τινὰ παρελθεῖν διὰ τῆς ὁδοῦ ἐκείνης	1	They were coming…were very violent, so that no one could pass by on that road	The demons that were controlling these two men were so dangerous that no one could go through that area.
MAT	8	29	v9mp		ἰδοὺ	1	Behold	This marks the beginning of another event in the larger story. Your language may have a way of showing this.
MAT	8	29	gr2p	figs-rquestion	τί ἡμῖν καὶ σοί, Υἱὲ τοῦ Θεοῦ?	1	What do we have to do with you, Son of God?	The demons use a question but they are being hostile toward Jesus. Alternate translation: “Do not bother us, Son of God!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

MAT	8	29	u4jr	figs-rquestion	ἦλθες ὧδε πρὸ καιροῦ βασανίσαι ἡμᾶς	1	Have you come here to torment us before the set time?	Again, the demons use a question in a hostile way. Alternate translation: “You should not disobey God by punishing us before the specific time God has set when he will punish us!” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])
MAT	8	30	v91c	writing-background	δὲ	1	Now	This word is used here to mark a break in the main story line. Here Matthew tells background information about a herd of pigs that had been there before Jesus arrived. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-background]])
MAT	8	31	tf32	figs-explicit	εἰ ἐκβάλλεις ἡμᾶς	1	If you cast us out	It is implied that the demons knew that Jesus was going to cast them out. Alternate translation: “Because you are going to cast us out” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])
MAT	8	31	cgf7	figs-exclusive	ἡμᾶς	1	us	This is exclusive, meaning the demons only. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-exclusive]])
MAT	8	32	h86e		αὐτοῖς	1	to them	This refers to the demons inside the men.
MAT	8	32	gtx2		οἱ…ἐξελθόντες ἀπῆλθον εἰς τοὺς χοίρους	1	the demons came out and went into the pigs	“The demons left the man and entered the pigs”

MAT	8	34	j6sp	figs-metonymy	πᾶσα ἡ πόλις	1	all the city	The word “city” is a metonym for the people of the city. The word “all” is probably an exaggeration to emphasize how very many people came out. Not necessarily every person came out. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metonymy]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-hyperbole]])
MAT	8	34	bsf4		τῶν ὁρίων αὐτῶν	1	their region	“their area”
MAT	9	intro	tg41			0		# Matthew 09 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### “Sinners”<br><br>When the people of Jesus’ time spoke of “sinners,” they were talking about people who did not obey the law of Moses and instead committed sins like stealing or sexual sins. When Jesus said that he came to call “sinners,” he meant that only people who believe that they are sinners can be his followers. This is true even if they are not what most people think of as “sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sin]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Passive voice<br><br>Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### Rhetorical questions<br><br>Speakers in this chapter asked questions to which they already knew the answer. They asked the questions to show that they were not happy with the hearers or to teach them or to get them to think. Your language may have another way of doing this. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])<br><br>### Proverbs<br><br>Proverbs are very short sentences that use words that are easy to remember to tell about something that is generally true. People who understand proverbs usually have to know much about the language and culture of the speaker. When you translate the proverbs in this chapter, you may have to use many more words than the speakers used so that you can add information that the hearers knew but your reader do not know. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/writing-proverbs]])<br>

Jesus uses this question to make the scribes think about what might prove whether or not he could really forgive sins. Alternate translation: “I just said ‘Your sins are forgiven.’ You may think that it is harder to say ‘Get up and walk,’ because the proof of whether or not I can heal the man will be shown by whether or not he gets up and walks.” or “You may think that it is easier to say ‘Your sins are forgiven’ than it is to say ‘Get up and walk.’” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-rquestion]])

MAT	9	9	q438		ἀναστὰς, ἠκολούθησεν αὐτῷ	1	he got up and followed him	“Matthew got up and followed Jesus.” This means Matthew became Jesus’ disciple.

MAT	11	intro	puf4			0		# Matthew 11 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set quotations from the Old Testament farther to the right on the page than the rest of the text. The ULT does this with the quoted material in 11:10.<br><br>Some scholars believe that [Matthew 11:20](../../mat/11/20.md) begins a new stage in the ministry of Christ because of Israel’s rejection of him.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Hidden revelation<br><br>After [Matthew 11:20](../../mat/11/20.md), Jesus begins to reveal information about himself and about the plans of God the Father, while hiding this information from those who reject him ([Matthew 11:25](../../mat/11/25.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### “The kingdom of heaven is near”<br><br>No one knows for sure whether the “kingdom of heaven” was present or still coming when John spoke these words.

MAT	11	18	qe7y	figs-synecdoche	μήτε ἐσθίων μήτε πίνων	1	not eating or drinking	Here “bread” refers to food. It does not mean that John never ate food.

Alternate translation: “they say that he is a gluttonous man and a drunkard…sinners.” or “they accuse him of eating and drinking too much and of being…sinners.” If you translated “The Son of Man” as “I, the Son of man,” you can state this as an indirect statement and use the first person. Alternate translation: “they say that I am a gluttonous man and a drunkard…sinners.” (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-quotations]] and [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-123person]])

MAT	12	intro	y7z6			0		# Matthew 12 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 12:18-21, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The Sabbath<br><br>This chapter has much to say about how God’s people are to obey the Sabbath. Jesus said that the rules that the Pharisees made up did not help people obey the Sabbath the way God wanted them to. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/sabbath]])<br><br>### “Blasphemy against the Spirit”<br><br>No one knows for sure what actions people perform or what words they say when they commit this sin. However, they probably insult the Holy Spirit and his work. Part of the Holy Spirit’s work is to make people understand that they are sinners and that they need to have God forgive them. Therefore, anyone who does not try to stop sinning is probably committing blasphemy against the Spirit. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/blasphemy]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/holyspirit]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Brothers and sisters<br><br>Most people call those who have the same parents “brother” and “sister” and think of them as the most important people in their lives. Many people also call those with the same grandparents “brother” and “sister.” In this chapter Jesus says that the most important people to him are those who obey his Father in heaven. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/brother]])<br>

MAT	13	intro	s3lu			0		# Matthew 13 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 13:14-15, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>This chapter begins a new section. It contains some of Jesus’ parables about the kingdom of heaven.<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metonymy<br><br>Jesus often says the word “heaven” when he wants his hearers to think of God, who lives in heaven ([Matthew 13:11](../../mat/13/11.md)).<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When Matthew wrote that Jesus “sat beside the sea” ([Matthew 13:1](../../mat/13/01.md)), he probably expected his hearers to know that Jesus was about to teach the people. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-explicit]])<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Speakers often use words for things that can be touched to speak of things that cannot be touched. Jesus spoke of a bird eating a seed to describe how Satan kept people from understanding Jesus’ message ([Matthew 13:19](../../mat/13/19.md)).<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Passive voice<br><br>Many sentences in this chapter tell that a person had something happen to him without saying who caused that something to happen. For example, “they were scorched” ([Matthew 13:6](../../mat/13/06.md)). You may have to translate the sentence so that it tells the reader who performed the action. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-activepassive]])<br><br>### Parables<br><br>The parables were short stories that Jesus told so that people would easily understand the lesson he was trying to teach them. He also told the stories so that those who did not want to believe in him would not understand the truth ([Matthew 13:11-13](./11.md)).<br>

MAT	16	intro	za2k			0		# Matthew 16 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Yeast<br><br>Jesus spoke of the way people thought about God as if it were bread, and he spoke of what people taught about God as if it were the yeast that makes bread dough become larger and the baked bread taste good. He did not want his followers to listen to what the Pharisees and Sadducees taught. This was because if they did listen, they would not understand who God is and how he wants his people to live. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Important figures of speech in this chapter<br><br>### Metaphor<br><br>Jesus told his people to obey his commands. He did this by telling them to “follow” him. It is as if he were walking on a path and they were walking after him. (See: [[rc://en/ta/man/translate/figs-metaphor]])<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Background information<br><br>Matthew continues his account from chapter 15 in verses 1-20. The account stops in verse 21 so Matthew can tell the reader that Jesus told his disciples again and again that people would kill him after he arrived in Jerusalem. Then the account continues in verses 22-27 with what happened the first time Jesus told the disciples that he would die.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. Jesus uses a paradox when he says, “Whoever wants to save his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it” ([Matthew 16:25](../../mat/16/25.md)).<br>

MAT	17	intro	yb4k			0		# Matthew 17 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Elijah<br><br>The Old Testament prophet Malachi lived many years before Jesus was born. Malachi had said that before the Messiah came a prophet named Elijah would return. Jesus explained that Malachi had been talking about John the Baptist. Jesus said this because John the Baptist had done what Malachi had said that Elijah would do. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/prophet]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/christ]])<br><br>### “transfigured”<br><br>Scripture often speaks of God’s glory as a great, brilliant light. When people see this light, they are afraid. Matthew says in this chapter that Jesus’ body shone with this glorious light so that his followers could see that Jesus truly was God’s Son. At the same time, God told them that Jesus was his Son. (See: [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/glory]] and [[rc://en/tw/dict/bible/kt/fear]])<br>

In this way he was like a king who came into a city after he had won an important battle. Also, the kings of Israel in the Old Testament rode on a donkeys. Other kings rode on horses.

MAT	22	intro	k5ze			0		# Matthew 22 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in verse 44, which are words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Wedding Feast<br><br>In the parable of the wedding feast ([Matthew 22:1-14](./01.md)), Jesus taught that when God offers to save a person, that person needs to accept the offer. Jesus spoke of life with God as a feast that a king prepares for his son, who has just gotten married. In addition, Jesus emphasized that not everyone whom God invites will properly prepare themselves to come to the feast. God will throw these people out from the feast.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Implicit information<br><br>Speakers usually do not say things that they think their hearers already understand. When the king in the parable said, “My oxen and fattened calves have been killed” ([Matthew 22:4](../../mat/22/04.md)), he assumed that the hearers would understand that those who had killed the animals had also cooked them.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible. To the Jews, the ancestors were the masters of the descendants, but in one psalm David calls one of his descendants “Lord.” Jesus tells the Jewish leaders that this is a paradox, saying, “If David then calls the Christ ‘Lord,’ how is he David’s son?” ([Matthew 22:45](../../mat/22/45.md)).<br>

The Pharisees made rules that no one could actually obey, and then they persuaded the ordinary people that they were guilty because they could not obey the rules. Also, the Pharisees obeyed their own rules instead of obeying God’s original commands in the law of Moses.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Name calling<br><br>In most cultures, it is wrong to insult people. The Pharisees took many of the words in this chapter as insults. Jesus called them “hypocrites,” “blind guides,” “fools,” and “serpents” ([Matthew 23:16-17](./16.md)). Jesus uses these words say that God would surely punish them because they were doing wrong.<br><br>### Paradox<br><br>A paradox is a true statement that appears to describe something impossible.

MAT	26	intro	mtq8			0		# Matthew 26 General Notes<br>## Structure and formatting<br><br>Some translations set each line of poetry farther to the right than the rest of the text to make it easier to read. The ULT does this with the poetry in 26:31, which is words from the Old Testament.<br><br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### Sheep<br>Sheep are a common image used in Scripture to refer to the people of Israel. In [Matthew 26:31](../../mat/26/31.md), however, Jesus used the words “the sheep” to refer to his disciples and to say that they would run away when he was arrested.<br><br>### Passover<br>The Passover festival was when the Jews would celebrate the day God killed the firstborn sons of the Egyptians but “passed over” the Israelites and let them live.<br><br>### The eating of the body and blood<br>[Matthew 26:26-28](./26.md) describes Jesus’ last meal with his followers. At this time, Jesus told them that what they were eating and drinking were his body and his blood. Nearly all Christian churches celebrate “the Lord’s Supper,” the “Eucharist”, or “Holy Communion” to remember this meal.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### Judas’ kiss for Jesus<br>[Matthew 26:49](../../mat/26/49.md) describes how Judas kissed Jesus so the soldiers would know whom to arrest. The Jews would kiss each other when they greeted each other.<br><br>### “I am able to destroy the temple of God”<br>Two men accused Jesus of saying that he could destroy the temple in Jerusalem and then rebuild it “in three days” ([Matthew 26:61](../../mat/26/61.md)). They were accusing him of insulting God by claiming that God had given him the authority to destroy the temple and the power to rebuild it. What Jesus actually said was that if the Jewish authorities were to destroy this temple, he would certainly raise it up in three days ([John 2:19](../../jhn/02/19.md)).<br>

MAT	28	intro	psw9			0		# Matthew 28 General Notes<br>## Special concepts in this chapter<br><br>### The tomb<br><br>The tomb in which Jesus was buried ([Matthew 28:1](../../mat/28/01.md)) was the kind of tomb in which wealthy Jewish families buried their dead. It was an actual room cut into a rock. It had a flat place on one side where they could place the body after they had put oil and spices on it and wrapped it in cloth. Then they would roll a large rock in front of the tomb so no one could see inside or enter.<br><br>### “Make disciples”<br><br>The last two verses ([Matthew 28:19-20](./19.md)) are commonly known as “The Great Commission” because they contain a very important command given to all Christians. Christians are to “make disciples” by going to people, sharing the gospel with them and training them to live as Christians.<br><br>## Other possible translation difficulties in this chapter<br><br>### An angel of the Lord<br><br>Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John all wrote about angels in white clothing with the women at Jesus’ tomb. Two of the authors called them men, but that is only because the angels looked human. Two of the authors wrote about two angels, but the other two authors wrote about only one of them. It is best to translate each of these passages as it appears in the ULT without trying to make the passages all say exactly the same thing. (See: [Matthew 28:1-2](../../mat/28/01.md) and [Mark 16:5](../../mrk/16/05.md) and [Luke 24:4](../../luk/24/04.md) and [John 20:12](../../jhn/20/12.md))<br>
